                My name is Raul and I am a talented barber and full stack
                developer. I have been working in the barbering industry for
                three decades and have developed a keen eye for details. In my
                free time, I enjoy listening to music and drawing, I have always
                had a love for music and find that it helps to relax and inspire
                me in my work.
                <br />
                <br />I initially started coding as a hobby, but quickly
                realized that it was something I was truly passionate about and
                decided to pursue a career change. It was a big decision, but I
                am excited to be able to do what I love and help others in the
                process

                My name is Ridwan, I am a talented entrepreneur and a full stack
                developer. I have work in many field of life. I found myself
                following my dad to site as an electrician which make me a
                professional in that field and I went on to read electrical and
                computer engineering in University. I have passion in building
                something that is working so I started a tech company which make
                me learn many skill like product management, sale, uiux and
                leadership skill.
                <br />
                <br />I initially started coding when my company filed due to
                lack of my expertise in frontend and backend field and since I
                have little or no money to employ good one. It's a big decision
                for me to change my career to developer, but I love it because
                it make me help lot of business.
